FIXME

## Devenv
I'm using [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes) and [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/) to develop this library. If you want to contribute, it's strongly recommended that you [install nix with flakes support](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) and then either run `bin/start-devenv` or if you prefer a seamless direnv experience, `cp .envrc.sample .envrc && direnv allow` which will enable the environment every time you enter the directory.

The flake.nix itself is mostly boilerplate I use in every project - the real seitan of the setup can be found in the devenv.nix file, which should be a lot more approachable for non-nix users too.

## Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

Invoke a library API function from the command-line:

    $ clojure -X socksy.kahawa/foo :a 1 :b '"two"'
    {:a 1, :b "two"} "Hello, World!"

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build a JAR (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the JAR in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

Install it locally (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment
variables (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build deploy

Your library will be deployed to net.clojars.socksy/kahawa on clojars.org by default.
